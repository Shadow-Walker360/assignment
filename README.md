  - **Flexibility:** Iterative cycles allow for changes based on feedback.  
  - **Customer Involvement:** Frequent interactions with stakeholders ensure the product meets evolving needs.  
  - **Faster Time-to-Market:** Incremental releases can provide earlier value.
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - **Less Predictability:** Planning can be less detailed, leading to uncertainty in final deliverables.  
  - **Potential Scope Creep:** Without strict controls, continuous changes might expand the project beyond initial boundaries.
  - **Requires High Collaboration:** Success depends on continuous communication and a disciplined team.

**Waterfall Methodology:**  
- **Advantages:**  
  - **Structured Process:** Clear phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) provide strong documentation and predictability.  
  - **Easy Tracking:** Well-defined milestones make it easier to measure progress.  
  - **Clear Deliverables:** Each phase has specific outcomes before moving on.
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - **Inflexibility:** Changes later in the project are difficult and costly to implement.  
  - **Late Testing:** Problems might not be detected until the testing phase, potentially causing delays.  
  - **Customer Involvement:** Limited stakeholder engagement after the requirements phase may result in a product that doesn’t fully meet current needs.
